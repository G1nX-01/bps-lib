# bps-lib
A small library that can make a whole, customizable particles simulator inside your browser.
All you need is a canvas and this library.

# Documentation
Just import it like a normal library, like this:
```html
<script src="https://g1nx-01.github.io/bps-lib/bps.min.js"></script>
```
For the simulation to work:
```javascript
let simulation = bps(canvasId <string>, particleCount <number>, temperature <number>, pressure <number>, evadeMouse <bool> )
```

If you want to reset it:
```javascript
reset()
```
 
That's basically it lmfao
